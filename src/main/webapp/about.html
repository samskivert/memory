  <h1>Spare Cortex Manifesto</h1>

  <p> I have progressed through a broad variety of personal information
      management tools over the course of my life, and they invariably fail to
      meet my needs in one way or another. This periodically motivates a flurry
      of note taking on what would comprise the “perfect” personal information
      management system, which I generally record using whatever duct tape and
      baling wire contraption I am currently using to keep track of things, and
      then promptly forget about. </p>

  <p> About half a decade ago, I wrote
      a <a href="http://samskivert.com/code/jikan">standalone application</a>
      that handled the parts of PIM that were done wrongly, in my opinion, by
      other tools (keeping lists of tasks to do, a journal of daily doings, and
      seeing at a glance what events were upcoming and recently past). It kept
      the urges to write a more comprehensive system at bay, and I got by with
      my tool, a haphazard collection of wikis and text files, and Google
      calendar. </p>

  <p> My entry into the world of computer science research last year triggered
      a dramatic increase in my generation of notes and ideas that needed
      keeping track of, not to mention a much more finely divided schedule. To
      meet my increased PIM needs, I
      tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/w2wiki/">minimalist
      solutions</a>, <a href="http://twiki.org/">maximalist solutions</a>, and
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/">Googly solutions</a>
      (among <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">a</a>
      <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">dozen</a>
      <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">others</a>
      <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">.</a>
      <a href="http://backpackit.com/">.</a>
      <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/">.</a>).
      Each rewarded my substantial organizational efforts with eventual
      dissatisfaction and malaise. My resolve eventually eroded and I succumbed
      to my perennial urge to write my own all-singing, all-dancing,
      wiki/todo/calendar/datastore/dwim application. </p>

  <p> I thus wrote <a href="/">Spare Cortex</a>, an unabashed indulgence in my
      own personal information management needs. To atone for the sin of
      polluting the world with yet another wiki, I have strived to make it
      usable by people other than its author. I have provided
      a <a href="http://sparecortex.com/c/demo">demonstration of its basic
      functionality</a> to help interested parties determine whether it is
      worth the time investment of trying out. </p>

  <p> My motivations in creating the system (which you may compare to your own
      PIM motivations to gauge your interest) were as follows: </p>

  <ul>
  <li> It should not extravagantly waste a quarter or more of its screen real
       estate on headers, banners, navigation links and other wikijunk (to
       paraphrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk">Tufte</a>). </li>

  <li> It should be hierarchical. The flat namespace of most wiki systems
       breaks down once you add half a dozen projects each with a dozen pages
       of content. Prefixing the name of every page with the name of its
       parents scales poorly. </li>

  <li> It should support structured content (most importantly checklists, and
       what I call “pages”) natively. Configuring half a dozen poorly
       implemented and unmaintained plugins is a punishment I’d rather
       avoid. </li>

  <li> With regard to checklists, having to open the wiki editor and scroll
       down through a sea of text to find a todo item to check off (or edit, or
       move up or down in priority) is painful. </li>

  <li> With regard to pages, any project that does not die an early death will
       eventually accumulate sort of “dashboard” at its top-level, containing
       outstanding todo items, lists of useful resources, and the top-level
       links to the copious notes that you’ve taken as the project evolves.
       Basic page layout capabilities enable one to organize this dashboard
       page in a way that allows easy viewing of what’s going on with the
       project and easy updating of ephemeral data. </li>

  <li> Furthermore, I don’t want that data landlocked amidst semi-structured
       text. I should be able to see all of the tasks across all of my
       projects, or tag individual tasks and place a view of tasks with e.g.
       the today tag on my top-level “life dashboard” page, alongside my
       appointments and journal (note: the tagging feature is not yet complete,
       but is forthcoming). </li>

  <li> Parts of pages, like checklists, should be accessible at individual URLs
       which are mobile web browser friendly, so that you can readily access
       any task list while on the go, and quickly add whatever thought popped
       into your head. </li>

  <li> It should support the attachment of media to individual pages, again not
       constrained by a global namespace. </li>

  <li> It should be searchable (not yet implemented) and support bulk import
       and export (also not yet implemented). </li>

  <li> It should support access controls to enable sharing subtrees (or an
       entire tree) in a read-only or read-write manner with other people, or
       with the anonymous public (partly implemented). </li>
  </ul>

  <p> If you’ve managed to read this far and are not simply in shock at this
      display of raw enthusiasm for something of such little consequence,
      please <a href="/">give Spare Cortex a whirl</a>. </p>
